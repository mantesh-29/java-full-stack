        <h3>CSS (Cascadibg Style Sheets)</h3>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the look and feel (presentation) 
            of a document written in HTML or XML. It separates the content (HTML) from the design (CSS), 
            making websites more attractive and easier to maintain.</p>

            <h3>CSS Full Form</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
            <li><strong>Cascading: </strong>Refers to the way styles are applied: <strong>newer or more specific rules override older or general ones.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Style Sheets:</strong>A set of rules that define how HTML elements should be displayed.</li>
              </ul>

        <h3>Purpose of CSS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To design and control the layout of multiple web pages at once.</li>
            <li>To apply <strong>styles</strong> such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Colors</li>
                <li>Fonts  & Typography</li>
                <li>Spacing (margins, padding, line-height)</li>
                <li>Page Layout (grid, flexbox,positioning)</li>
                <li>Backgrounds (color, image, gradient),Borders, Animations, Transitions</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CSS can be used in 3 ways in HTML</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inline CSS:</strong> Styles are applied directly to HTML elements using the <q>style</q> attribute.</li>
            <li><strong>Internal CSS:</strong> Styles are defined within a &lt;style&gt; tag in the head section of the HTML document.</li>
            <li><strong>External CSS:</strong> Styles are defined in separate .css files and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Inline CSS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Applied directly to an individual HTML element using the <code><q>style</q></code> attribute inside the tag.</li>
            <li><strong>Use case:</strong> For quick styling of a single element.</li>
            <li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Not recommended for large projects (difficult to maintain).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Internal CSS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Styles are written within a &lt;style&gt; tag in the head section of the HTML document.</li>
            <li><strong>Use case:</strong> For styling a single <strong>HTML Page</strong> only.</li>
            <li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Styles are not reusable across multiple pages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>External CSS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Styles are stored in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML file using the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag.</li>
            <li><strong>Use case:</strong> Best for large websites because one CSS file can style multiple pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Makes the website consistent, easy to maintain, and faster.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="selectors"><h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
        <h3>What are CSS Selectors?</h3>
        <p>CSS selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style in your HTML document. They allow you to apply styles to specific elements based on their type, class, id, attributes, and more.</p>

        <h3>Types of CSS Selectors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Element Selector:</strong> Selects all elements of a given type (e.g., <code>p</code>, <code>h1</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Class Selector:</strong> Selects elements with a specific class (e.g., <code>.classname</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>ID Selector:</strong> Selects an element with a specific ID (e.g., <code>#idname</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Attribute Selector:</strong> Selects elements based on their attributes (e.g., <code>[type="text"]</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Pseudo-classes:</strong> Selects elements based on their state (e.g., <code>:hover</code>, <code>:first-child</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Pseudo-elements:</strong> Selects parts of an element (e.g., <code>::before</code>, <code>::after</code>).</li>

    box model:
<h3>Box Model</h3>
<p></p>
    Browsers treat eery element as a box . A box contains 
     border,
     border-radius
     padding
     margin


     <h3>Border:</h3><p>Border is the surrounding line for an element</p>
<code>
    border: size shape color;
</code>
we can even assign 
border-left;
border-right;
border-top;
border-bottom;
    </div>

<div>

    border radius: it is the corner radius surround the border corners. 
    border-radius:size;
    50% of border radius makes actual circle for square shape.
    we can also assign each corner radius saperately.
</div>
<div>
    padding:
    it is the space between border and actual content of element(inside the element)
    padding: size ;
    we ccan also assign padding as padding left, padding-right,,padding-top, padding-bottom.
</div>
<div>normally padding makes each box increased its height or width because by default all are content boxes. so we need to use 
    box-sizing: border-box;
</div>
<div>margin:
    it is the space outside the border.
    used for gap between the elements.
    margin:size;
    we can also assign margin as amrgin-left,
    margin-right,margin-top,margin-bottom;
</div>

    <section id="display-float"><h3>Display and float</h3>
    
    float: float is used to make any element floating to the left or right side of screen , it makes the element removev from actual execution and next element takes up the spacce of floating element.
    float: left/right/none;
    we can even clear the floating elements for any other element using 
    clear: left/right/both;



    <p>
        Display: display is used to arrange the elements in a specific way
    </p>
    display : block;
    will make the elements into block so that each element will display in a a new line.
    display: inline;
    make the elements into inline so that each element follows the previous element(maintains same flow)
     but inline elements can not handle height or width or verticle margins.

     display: inline-block;
     works like inline but accepts height or width.
     display: none;
     removes the elements(visibility hidden just hides the elements )- element will not take any space when using display: none;
     

position: positions is used to keep elements at different places in user interface. There are 5 positions available in css such as 
absolute: absolute elements move according to the position of body. So left: 0px; will actually move towards leftmost end of screen, scrolling have impact on absolute.
relative:  relative elements move according to the position of current position, so left: 0px; will not have impact towards it. 
static:   by default , all elements are static. static elements can not have top,left,right,bottom.
fixed: fixed elements also move according to body but it will not scroll 
sticky: sticky is notihing but relatve + fixed so intially it stays like relative but ones it reaches certain point it becomes foxed. untill its parent end reached.

    <section id="flex">
        <p>Flex: flexbox is used to arrange the elements in single direction either row or column

            parent properties: flexbox allows its parent to have below properties like 
            display: flex;
            it is used to arrange child items in single direction default row
            flex-direction: it is used to arrange child items in specific direction.
            row/row-reverse/column/column-reverse    
            gap: it is used to provide gapes between the items\
            axis in which elemets are arranged is called main axis and axis which elements not arranged (oppsite to mian axis) is called axis
        </div>
          justify-content: it is used to move the elements along the main axis (left/right/center/start/end/space-between/space-around/spacce-evenly)
        
        align-items: it is used to move the elements along the cross axis (left/right/center/start/end)
    
    
    flex-wrap---   it is used to wwrwap the elements into new lines and 
align-content: it is used to move the lines done by flex wrap

child properties: 
order: it is used to arrange child item individually at any place by default order is 0 and elemetns are arranged based on order's increasing order.
align-self: it is used to adjust elemnt individually acroos cross axis.
flex-shrink: it is used to shrink more than the other elements.
flex-grow: it is used to grow more than the other elements. 
flex-basis: it is used to make an element same without grow or shrink.

    <section id="grid">
        Grid: grid is a modern responsive css layout which is used to display items or elements in 2 dimensional way (rows and columns) in a web page. 
    
        parent propertiers:
         display: grid    it is used to make the container grid and it fits all its child items as a single columns,
         grid-template-columns: it is used to specifiy individual columns width grid-template-columns : 100px 50px 200px; 
         create 3 columns of respective widths.
         gid-template-columns: 20% 50% 30% ;
         creates 3 columns of respective percentages.
         grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 3fr;
         divides into 3 columns of respective fractions.
         we can also specify repeat(n,x) where is n is no. of time to repeat x value.


         grid template rows it is used to specify each rows height similarly grid-template columns

         gap : it is used to provide gap between the items. we can also specify 
         row-gap and column-gap
 
         justify-content: it is used to move items along row-gap
         align-content: it is used to move items along column

         child properties:

         we need to divide and understand grid as grid tracks (grid row lines and grid column lines)




        grid-column-start: starting column line number
        grid-column-end: endning column line number
        grid-column: grid-column-start/grid-column-end;
        grid-row-start: starting row line number
        grid-row-end: ending row line number
        grid-row: grid-row-start/grid-row-end;
        grid-area: grid-row-start/grid-column-start/grid-row-end/grid-column-end;
        order: by default every element order of order proeprty.
